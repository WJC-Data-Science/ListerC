In this first visualization I wanted to point out how I like the feature of the percentage bar next to the affordability % as it is nice to have a visual reference. I also like how the visualization is simple and to the point with visualizing the data. One thing I think this visualization could improve upon would be taking into consideration more than just income/house prices such as utilities and cost of living etc. Also Independence and KCK are listed in the top 40!

# Visualization #2
## "Average Renters Insurance Premium vs Percentage of City that is Black"

In this visualization I like that a simple scatter plot is used and efficiently presents the data. I also  like that this visualization presents a trendline for the data. One thing I think this visualization could do better on would be showing the data in a less zoomed view as most of the data is between the 0% and 10% interval. 

# Visualization #3
## "Popularity of Solar Versus Days of Sun in Metro Areas"

In this visualization I like that the visualization has distinct lines that show the variables on the x and y axis. This makes it easier for me to read the numerical significance. I also like that this visualization also has a trendline. I understand that that labeling each dot would make the visualization not as clean, but I wish I knew what some of the cities are that are not listed.

# Visualization #4
## "How Valuable is Data to Your Organizations Overall Sucess"

In this visualization I like the bar chart are it is simple and effective with displaying the data. I also like how the colors within the visualization stand out (the pink). What I do not like how this visualization is its bias and would be curios to see what categories data is not valuable in.
