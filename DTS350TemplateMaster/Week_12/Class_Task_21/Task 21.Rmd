The first visualization I used was the a simple line graph that showed the yearly preformance of Krogers Stock price since 2015. In this visualization we see the largest drop in price in the summer of 2017 and the largest growth betweeen the winter of 2019 and the summer of 2020.
In my second visualization I again used a line graph that represented Kroger stock between April 2019 to currently if I had invested $10,000 in April of 2018. After our intial investment we see the stock price rise and then fall in the summer of 2019, before it grdually climbs amimd the pandemic reccession.
