### Chance Lister

# My Cover Letter
Dear Hiring Manager,

I, Chance Lister, am submitting my resume for consideration for the position Data Scientist at Future Employer at the Kansas City location. Given the skills and experience in my enclosed resume, I believe I could be a worthy asset to your team. 

In my final semester at William Jewell College, I completed a multitude of coursework dealing with data loading, data cleaning, data visualization, and R coding capabilities. Through these principles, I have learned and applied skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, leadership, and analytical skills.

The principles I learned during this coursework were taught through daily tasks that included coding and analysis practice, case studies that involved looking at real data and coming to conclusions from the data, and the semester long project where I complied data, created questions about the data, and then answered and presented my findings.

Finally, from these principles I have learned the applied skill of thinking critically from doing multiple case studies on real world issues. I have learned problem-solving skills from working with the coding language of R and finding answers to my own questions. I also learned leadership skills through leading multiple team meetings on case studies throughout the semester. Finally, I have grown my analytic skills from multiple instances of data analysis. 

From my experiences and practical skills listed above, I believe I could be a great addition to your team. As I start my journey into my professional career, I could not think of a better place to begin than at Future employer. Thank you for your time and I am eager to hear back from you!

Best Regards,
Chance Lister

### Task 23 [X]

Coding Challenge II

#Analysis Final Project

## Task 1

### Data Driven Answers

#### Visualization #1
##### "The Most Affordable Places to Buy a Home in America"

![alt text](https://www.refiguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image3-768x748.png)

https://www.refiguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image3-768x748.png

In this first visualization I wanted to point out how I like the feature of the percentage bar next to the affordability % as it is nice to have a visual reference. I also like how the visualization is simple and to the point with visualizing the data. One thing I think this visualization could improve upon would be taking into consideration more than just income/house prices such as utilities and cost of living etc. Also Independence and KCK are listed in the top 40!

### Visualization #2
#### "Average Renters Insurance Premium vs Percentage of City that is Black"

![alt text](https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/scatterplot-wm-1.png)

https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/scatterplot-wm-1.png

In this visualization I like that a simple scatter plot is used and efficiently presents the data. I also like that this visualization presents a trendline for the data. One thing I think this visualization could do better on would be showing the data in a less zoomed view as most of the data is between the 0% and 10% interval. 

#### Visualization #3
##### "Popularity of Solar Versus Days of Sun in Metro Areas"

![alt text](https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1415/solarversussun.png)

https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1415/solarversussun.png

In this visualization I like that the visualization has distinct lines that show the variables on the x and y axis. This makes it easier for me to read the numerical significance. I also like that this visualization also has a trendline. I understand that that labeling each dot would make the visualization not as clean, but I wish I knew what some of the cities are that are not listed.

#### Visualization #4
##### "How Valuable is Data to Your Organizations Overall Sucess"

![alt text](https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1412/image1.png)

https://pix-media.priceonomics-media.com/blog/1412/image1.png

In this visualization I like the bar chart are it is simple and effective with displaying the data. I also like how the colors within the visualization stand out (the pink). What I do not like how this visualization is its bias and would be curios to see what categories data is not valuable in.

## Task 3

### Novel Questions

#### Does the college you attend have a direct correlation to your post grad salary?

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/does-it-matter-where-you-go-college/577816/

#### Is there a correlation between a parents income and child's highschool/college graduation percentage?
https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc272e.pdf

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2891175/

#### Do socially responsible companies see more profits?

https://business-ethics.com/2015/05/05/does-corporate-social-responsibility-increase-profits/

https://www.business.com/articles/can-you-make-a-profit-and-be-socially-responsible/

## Task 7

### Quote from "What do people do with new data"

"The first thing I do is fool around abit to try to figure out what the data set looks like". I like this quote as often I feel lost when I start coding, and one way I can feel less lost is to start looking at my data and what it means.

## Task 8
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
### Data Sources

#### Data Set 1 Tesla Stock
```{r, message=FALSE}
TSLA <- read_csv("TSLA.csv")
```
Tesla stock price since 2010, with highs, lows, opens, closing prices, and volume.A good data set for Tesla but lacks more overall information for proposed question.

##### Tesla Visualization Example
```{r}
tesla_stock <- ggplot(data = TSLA) +
  geom_path(mapping = aes(x = Date, y = High)) +
  theme_grey() +
  labs(title = "Tesla Stock High Since 2010")
tesla_stock
```

#### Data Set 2 Tidyquants

library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)

Tidyquant is a package within the tidyverse that provides the stock data of every stock in the NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX. Within each stock there is the symbol, date, open, high, low, close, and volume.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(timetk)
library(dygraphs)
```

##### Tidyquant Visualization Example

```{r, warning=FALSE}
KR_prices1 <- tq_get("KR", get = "stock.prices", from = "2015-11-01", to = "2020-11-01")
KR_prices2 <- tq_get("KR", get = "stock.prices", from = "2018-04-05", to = "2020-11-01")

Yearly_Returns <- bind_rows(KR_prices1) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)
dygraph(Yearly_Returns, main = "Kroger Stock Price Performance Over 5 Years")
```

#### Read-in Proccess Summary

The read in process was fairly simple on both of these data sets, especially the latter as there is truly no "loading in" with this data as tidyquant contains all the data I need without being in a physical location.

#### Limitations

Some limitations on the Tesla data is that it is of course only Tesla data, so there is a lack of ability to answer my overarching question as I cannot look at other companies. The limitations on my Tidyquant data is that it is a very large frame of data, so to use the data I have to filter through years and which variable I deem most important to measure.

## Is Social Responsiblity a Prominent Indicator of Better Preforming Companies?

### Preface
Social resonsibiloy is defined as companies acting in the best interest of their environment and society as a whole.Examples include sustainable environmental practices, treating employees fairly through wages/safety, and being engaged and active in their communities. 

I choose stock prices as my measurable to compare companies as stock prices are a (mostly) accurate indicator of a companies financial health as stock prices are a reflection of the companies immediate future. That being said it is not a fair assumption to compare stock prices at a base level price for price, which is why I will be observing merely the trends of the stock price and not the stock price in it of itself.


### My Hypothesis
I think there is so many other factors such as overall market health, world events, and government policies, and the company itself that are correlated to the companies financial health and stock price movement, that I find it difficult for social responsibility to be the sole indicator of a company preforming better than another. Meaning, I do not think social responsibility will be a direct indicator of a better preforming stock price movement. 

### My Methodology
To accurately compare a socially responsible company and a non-socially responsible company I researched and created four industry categories to compare. These industry categories include, Resource Collecting (Timber/Oil), Renewable and Non Renewable Energy (Natural Gas/Coal), Automobile, and Energy Collecting (Wind/Fracking). I researched two companies for each category for a head to head comparison, one that ran on socially responsible principles and one that did not.

## The Anlaysis
```{r warning=FALSE}
WY_stock <- tq_get("WY", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")
BEP_stock <- tq_get("BEP", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")
TSLA_stock <- tq_get("TSLA", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")
EQNR_stock <- tq_get("EQNR", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")

BP_stock <- tq_get("BP", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")
ARLP_stock <- tq_get("ARLP", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")
F_stock <- tq_get("F", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")
EOG_stock <- tq_get("EOG", get = "stock.prices", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2020-12-07")
```
### All of the Companies
```{r, warning=FALSE}
all_Returns <- bind_rows(WY_stock,BEP_stock, TSLA_stock, EQNR_stock,BP_stock,ARLP_stock, F_stock, EOG_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(all_Returns, main = "All Companies in Sample Size")
```

### The Responsible Companies
```{r, warning=FALSE}
good_Returns <- bind_rows(WY_stock,BEP_stock, TSLA_stock, EQNR_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(good_Returns, main = "Socially Responsible Companies Performance Over Ten Years")
```
My first visualization is dominated by Tesla, and it is difficult to come to any conclusion with Tesla being such an outlier. 

### The Responsible Companies Excluding Tesla
```{r, warning=FALSE}
good_Returns2 <- bind_rows(WY_stock,BEP_stock, EQNR_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(good_Returns2, main = "Socially Responsible Companies Performance Over Ten Years Excluding Tesla")
```
From this visualization we see that BEP is currently trending towards/ is at its highest price, while EQNR & WY are currently on a bearish trend with peak trends for EQNR in September of 2018 and WY with peak trends in 2010.

### The Non Responsible Companies
```{r, warning=FALSE}
bad_Returns <- bind_rows(BP_stock,ARLP_stock, F_stock, EOG_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(bad_Returns, main = "Non-Responsible Companies Performance Over Ten Years")
```
In this visualization we see EOG has had mostly bullish tendencies with its peak being in October of 2018 but has been on a gradual decline since. ARLP, F, and BP have remained mostly stagnant since 2010 with a few rises and falls. ARLP and F both had their peaks in January of 2015 and January 2014. BP meanwhile had its peak in October of 2018.

### Comparision of Resource Collecting Companies
```{r, warning=FALSE}
land_Returns <- bind_rows(WY_stock,BP_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(land_Returns, main = "Weyerhaeuser (WY) & BP (BP) Comparision ")
```
In this visualization we see similar trends between our two resource collecting companies, with BP having the higher trend for most of the century, but since 2020 WY has a better trend comparatively. Overall the not so socially responsible company BP has the higher trend over the longer period of time.

### Comaprison of Renewable Energy & Non Renewable Energy
```{r, warning=FALSE}
renew_Returns <- bind_rows(BEP_stock,ARLP_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(renew_Returns, main = "Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) & Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP) Comparison")
```
In the second visualization comparing our energy companies we see that the socially responsible company BEP has been trending mostly upwards since 2010, whole ARLP has trended down since the end of 2014.

### Comparison of Automobile Companies Part 1
```{r, warning=FALSE}
auto_Returns <- bind_rows(TSLA_stock,F_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(auto_Returns, main = "TESLA (TSLA) & Ford (F) Comparison (2010's)")
```
This visualization more or less speaks for itself. 

### Comparision of Automobile Companies Part 2
```{r, warning=FALSE}
TSLA_stock2 <- tq_get("TSLA", get = "stock.prices", from = "2000-01-01", to = "2020-07-01")

F_stock2 <- tq_get("F", get = "stock.prices", from = "1950-01-01", to = "2020-07-01")


auto_Returns2 <- bind_rows(TSLA_stock2,F_stock2) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(auto_Returns2, main = "TESLA (TSLA) & Ford (F) Comparison (All Time)")
```
Even going back forty years, Ford's stock movement does not compare.

### Comparision of Energy Collecting Companies
```{r, warning=FALSE}
energy_Returns <- bind_rows(EQNR_stock,EOG_stock) %>%
  select(symbol, date, adjusted) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = adjusted) %>%
  tk_xts(date_var = date)

dygraph(energy_Returns, main = "Equinor ASA (EQNR) & EOG Resources (EOG) Comparison")
```
In our final visualization we see that EOG was trending upwards from late 2012 to late 2018 before declining heavily. Meanwhile EQNR has stayed mostly level throughout the decade with little change in stock price since 2010 (14.73) and currently (16.50). In this instance I would give EOG the upper hand as they did have a longer period (6 years) of upward trending stock price but it is worth noting they have had a much more significant fall than EQNR.

## In Conclusion

#### I think a point should be made that since 2019 most of the socially responsible companies are trending more upwards than the not so socially responsible companies.That being said, I think the conclusion is Social Responsibility does not play as significant of a role when comparing stock price trends. From above we saw a split two and two when comparing head to head from the same industry, and I do not think there is reasonable justification to believe from this evidence that social responsibility is a leading indicator of a better preforming company.
